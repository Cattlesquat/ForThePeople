<h2>Tips When Updating/Maintaining Module</h2>
Vassal Module development is a bit "wild west", in that anyone can jump in and 
do it, and anyone can upload a new one to the server! So by all means jump in 
and help! BUT, there are a few "delicate" aspects of updating a For The People 
module, and this file lists a few steps that "if followed" will make everyone's 
life easier. They are also documented here lest we forget them ourselves!    -- 
Brian Reynolds, 2020

<h2>A WORD OF WARNING</h2>   
This module does depend on quite a few "custom java classes". The most 
complicated ones have to do with the automatic stack reorganization (if you 
think it's slow now, wait till you see it without the custom classes!). The 
source java code for the classes IS included in the module "vmod" file, but 
modifying and maintaining custom java classes is considerably more painstaking 
than regular Vassal work, and is definitely "not for the faint of heart". You 
have been warned!

<h2>FIRST AND FOREMOST!</h2>
Most importantly, the four "Scenario" saves must be recreated afresh whenever 
there have been any changes to prototypes and internal logic. The 
"Refresh Counters" function is NOT sufficient, as there are aspects which this 
cannot touch! Therefore each of the four scenarios must be created again 
manually - frustrating, but only takes about 5-10 minutes.

<h2>Step 0 - (Optional-but-Recommended) See if the coast is clear!</h2>
<ul style="margin-top:-20px;">
<li>Email the person listed in the "How To Play" entry as the current maintainer 
    of the module and make sure they're not about to drop a giant new version or 
    something. You don't want to do a bunch of work for nothing, etc. If two 
    people are going to do work on the module, it's best for them to trade it 
    back and forth for periods of time so that only one person is editing the 
    module at the same time -- there is no practicable way to "merge changes" 
    between two versions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1 - Update Campaign/1861 Scenario</h2>
<ul style="margin-top:-20px;">
<li>Start with a "fresh VASSAL boot" of the module</li>
<li>From File/Scenario menu, select "Custom Game". Do NOT select the 
    Campaign/1861 scenario! That would load the old now-tainted save!</li>
<li>Join as "observer".</li>
<li>Click in the chat line so that the cursor is blinking there - this 
    makes sure the toolbar will have focus for hotkeys.</li>
    <li>Press Alt+Ctrl+Shift+P. This forces all the starting PC Markers to 
        "register" w/ the State control displays. This ONLY needs to be done
        with the 1861/Campaign scenario, not the other scenarios.</li>
    <li>Press Alt+Ctrl+Shift+A. It may take upwards of 20-30 seconds for 
        this command to process! This will force an automatic Stack Reorg of all 
        units, and will also make sure that the At Start PC Markers register 
        properly. 
        </li>
    <li>Click the "Clear Movement History" button at the upper right of the 
        toolbar. This ensures that if movement trails are turned on during play
        there will not be spurious trails leftover from the setup 
        phase.</li>
<li>"Save Game As..." and pick an appropriate save file name e.g. 1861-3-0</li>
<li>In the module editor, find the "Scenarios" entry at the bottom.</li>
<li>Edit the Campaign/1861 entry</li>
<li>Use the "Select File" button to replace the save with your newly created one.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 2 - Update 1862 Scenario</h2>
<ul style="margin-top:-20px;">
<li>Again, start with a "fresh VASSAL boot" of the module</li>
<li>From File/Scenario menu, select "Custom Game". Do NOT select the 
    1862 scenario! That would load the old now-tainted save!</li>
<li>Join as "observer".</li>
<li>Click in the chat line so that the cursor is blinking there - this 
    makes sure the toolbar will have focus for hotkeys.</li>
    <li>Press Alt+Ctrl+Shift+2. It may take <strong>upwards of a full 
        minute</strong> for this command to process! This will set up the board 
        for the 1862 scenario.
        </li>
    <li>Click the "Clear Movement History" button at the upper right of the 
        toolbar. This ensures that if movement trails are turned on during play
        there will not be spurious trails leftover from the setup 
        phase.</li>
<li>"Save Game As..." and pick an appropriate save file name e.g. 1862-3-0</li>
<li>In the module editor, find the "Scenarios" entry at the bottom.</li>
<li>Edit the 1862 entry</li>
<li>Use the "Select File" button to replace the save with your newly created one.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 3 - Update 1863 Scenario</h2>
<ul style="margin-top:-20px;">
<li>Again, start with a "fresh VASSAL boot" of the module</li>
<li>From File/Scenario menu, select "Custom Game". Do NOT select the 
    1863 scenario! That would load the old now-tainted save!</li>
<li>Join as "observer".</li>
<li>Click in the chat line so that the cursor is blinking there - this 
    makes sure the toolbar will have focus for hotkeys.</li>
    <li>Press Alt+Ctrl+Shift+3. It may take <strong>upwards of a full 
        minute</strong> for this command to process! This will set up the board 
        for the 1863 scenario.
        </li>
    <li>Click the "Clear Movement History" button at the upper right of the 
        toolbar. This ensures that if movement trails are turned on during play
        there will not be spurious trails leftover from the setup 
        phase.</li>
<li>"Save Game As..." and pick an appropriate save file name e.g. 1863-3-0</li>
<li>In the module editor, find the "Scenarios" entry at the bottom.</li>
<li>Edit the 1863 entry</li>
<li>Use the "Select File" button to replace the save with your newly created one.</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Step 4 - Update 1864 Scenario</h2>
<ul style="margin-top:-20px;">
<li>Again, start with a "fresh VASSAL boot" of the module</li>
<li>From File/Scenario menu, select "Custom Game". Do NOT select the 
    1864 scenario! That would load the old now-tainted save!</li>
<li>Join as "observer".</li>
<li>Click in the chat line so that the cursor is blinking there - this 
    makes sure the toolbar will have focus for hotkeys.</li>
    <li>Press Alt+Ctrl+Shift+4. It may take <strong>upwards of TWO FULL 
        MINUTES</strong> for this command to process! This will set up the board 
        for the 1864 scenario.
        </li>
    <li>Click the "Clear Movement History" button at the upper right of the 
        toolbar. This ensures that if movement trails are turned on during play
        there will not be spurious trails leftover from the setup 
        phase.</li>
<li>"Save Game As..." and pick an appropriate save file name e.g. 1864-3-0</li>
<li>In the module editor, find the "Scenarios" entry at the bottom.</li>
<li>Edit the 1864 entry</li>
<li>Use the "Select File" button to replace the save with your newly created one.</li>
</ul>

    
<h2>Step 5 - Optional But Recommended - adjust Change List and Credits</h2>
<ul style="margin-top:-20px;">
<li>Extract the "FTPHowToPlay.html" and "changelist.html" from the vmod file. 
    (You can temporarily rename the .vmod to a .zip file to make it easier to 
    view/extract files, then rename it back)</li>
<li>Update the FTPHowToPlay.html as appropriate. Add your name to the credits 
    near the top. Mark yourself as the current maintainer of the module ("you 
    break it, you buy it!"). Note the file needs to be placed at three different 
    locations in the Vmod/Zip file -- the one in the root directory is used for 
    the toolbar version of How To Play; the other two activate the entry on the 
    Help menu. When I do it, I make a separate version that includes real 
    hyperlinks for the Help menu version, because real hyperlinks fail in the 
    non-help-menu version. But you do you!
<li>Update the changelist.html to add your new changes to the top. Leave the old changelist notes there (unless you're doing a sweeping revision).</li>
<li>I recommend manually inserting your new versions into the file (don't 
    use Vassal editor for this).</li>
</ul>
