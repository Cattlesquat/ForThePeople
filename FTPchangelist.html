<h1>For The People VASSAL Module Change List</h1>
<h2>3.5 Changelist</h2>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul style="margin-top:-20px;">
    <li>Updated custom code to prevent "Obsolete Custom Code" messages with latest Vassal.</li>
    <li>Changed module settings to allow it to take advantage of improved Vassal performance</li>
    <li>Union Control of Mississippi now correctly adds 10 to USA Strategic Will (rather than subtracting 10 from Confederate). Thx Gabriel Schweitzer for bug report.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3.4 Changelist</h2>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul style="margin-top:-20px;">
    <li>Corrected a problem where pieces dragged together would sometimes "unstack".</li>
</ul>
<h2>3.3 Changelist</h2>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul style="margin-top:-20px;">
    <li>Can now place 8 Union SP in Washington DC all at once (with Alt+8 or right-click menu)</li>
    <li>Takes advantage of various nice VASSAL 3.4.0 features</li>
    <li>There is now a much more noticeable "drag threshold" (10 pixels instead of 1), so pieces/stacks won't be so pixel-sensitive and fidgety.</li>
    <li>Rollover text for groups of units does a better job of picking up other counters underneath (e.g. trenches) as well</li>
    <li>"Change Sides" button now defaults to opposite site for quicker "Hot Seat" play</li>
    <li>Ctrl+Mousewheel will zoom the map in and out (YAY! They let me put this in VASSAL! Coming soon to ALL your games...)</li>
    <li>Mousewheel in general should "scroll text windows faster", it used to be infuriatingly slow</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul style="margin-top:-20px;">
    <li>When an army was eliminated in the same space as an opposing army, extra SW penalty was being charged. This now correctly happens ONLY when an army is eliminated in the same space as another *friendly* army.</li>
    <li>Ewell and AP Hill were incorrectly missing from some scenario maps - fixed</li>
</ul>


<h2>3.2 Changelist</h2>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul style="margin-top:-20px;">
    <li>NOTE: any time the version number changes, I do NOT recommend using 
        saves made with earlier versions of the module -- finish any current 
        games using the version you started it with. Although they will "kind of 
        work", you will not actually most of the new improvements, especially 
        the performance-related ones. 
    </li>
    <li>Auto Organize Stacks now defaults to "off" - apparently my computer 
        is faster than I thought it was :)</li>
    <li>Substantial performance improvements, particularly with 
        auto-organize stacks off.</li>
    <li>Armies now have Ctrl+P hotkey to "Convert/Place PC Marker"</li>
    <li>Strength Point counters now have Expand (Ctrl+X) and Consolidate 
        (Ctrl+C) commands -- e.g. a 6 turns into a pile of six ones, and vice 
        versa. 
        </li>
    <li>Forts can be built by selecting empty spaces and picking Ctrl+F 
        (CSA) or Alt+F (USA). So that you don't have to go drag one all the way 
        across the map from the fort pool.</li>
    <li>"Middle" auto-organize level is now much faster but pared down.</li>
    <li>Game log reporting now allows bolding, multiple colors, etc, for 
        better clarity.</li>
    <li>Dice display symbols in log when rolled -- so cute!</li>
    <li>Scrolling improved in "How to Play" section.</li>
    <li>General cleanup and polish throughout.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul style="margin-top:-20px;">
    <li>Little Rock was missing from resource site list; fixed.</li>
    <li>Emancipation event was missing its card text.</li>
    <li>Create-Army options were sometimes greyed out improperly for 
        generals.</li>
    <li>Some cards when played for the event weren't displaying their card 
        text.</li>
    <li>Cavalry brigades eliminated from army displays weren't always 
        updating the Army SP count.</li>
    <li>Various typos fixed in card text, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3.1 Changelist</h2>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<ul style="margin-top:-20px;">
    <li>Armies now display commander's Strategy rating on left side of 
        counter.</li>
    <li>Army counter contains "*" if Army has at least one Cav Brigade, or 
        "!" if it is a MONGOL ARMY of only Cavalry(!)</li>
        <li>When randomizing generals on a map or board location (e.g. for 
            casualties rather than for initial placement), the name of the top
            General in the resulting stack is reported in the log, to improve
            clarity that the top one in the resulting stack is the intended 
            randomized casualty.</li>    
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul style="margin-top:-20px;">
    <li>Maintenance key added to force initial PC markers to self-register.</li>
    <li>State PC status now properly disappears when a border state flipped 
        from CSA to USA control.</li>
    <li>Army's internal cavalry count now updated properly when a Cav 
        Brigade is flipped to 2 SP. (was previously okay if 2 SP cav moved in or
        out, but not if flipped right there inside army.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3.0 Changelist</h2>

    <li>All-new module!</li>
    <li>Latest hi-res art supplied by Mark Simonitch from GMT.</li> 
    <li>Much automation now available to make record-keeping easier.</li>
    <li>Automatic stack reorganization</li>
    <li>Wherever possible, on-map charts have been turned "right side up" 
        for ease of on-screen play.</li>
    <li>Java source for custom classes incorporated into module.</li>
</ul>
