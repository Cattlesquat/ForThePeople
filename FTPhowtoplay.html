    style="float:right;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For The People 3.4</h1>     
<p style="font-size:22px;">
This new FTP module was created by <strong>Brian Reynolds</strong>. Special
thanks to <strong>Game Designer Mark Herman</strong> who answered esoteric rules 
questions during development, as well as Mark Simonitch from GMT who supplied 
the hi-res art from the latest edition of the game. Version 3.4 also takes advantage
of the new features found in VASSAL version 3.4.0+. Thanks also to Steve Petras, Knutz Grunitz, and
Judd Vance, along with anyone else who contributed to earlier versions of the
module -- much inspiration was drawn from their excellent work!

<br> <br>The module is presently maintained by <strong>Brian 
Reynolds</strong> - please report any problems to 
<strong>brian@brianreynolds.net</strong>. 
                                                       
 <br> <br>
    <h2 style="font-size:30px">First Things First</h2><p style="font-size:22px;">
Under the "Help" menu you will find a link to the latest <strong>Living 
Rules</strong> version of the For The People rulebook. If you are still 
learning how to play 
the game itself, several <strong>YouTube videos</strong> are available online,
including an excellent one by Mark Herman himself at 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmcAi-k2mCg <br> <br>

      <h2 style="font-size:30px">If It 'Runs Too Slow'</h2>

      <p style="font-size:22px;">
      As of version 3.2, Auto Stack Organization defaults to Off. If you find  
      the module running too slowly on your computer, go to the "Rules & 
      Preferences" tab (or <strong>Alt+R</strong> and turn off "Auto Stack 
      Organization". This will speed up unit movement at the expense of the 
      automatic organization of big stacks. You can still manually invoke the 
      reorganizer for a stack with <strong>Ctrl+A</strong>.
                                                          <br><br>

                                                  <h3 style="font-size:26px">1.
Choosing a Side</h3><p style="font-size:22px;">
The side you choose gives you access to its hand of cards--or choose Solitaire 
to have access to both (also useful for e.g. local play on one computer, or when 
using the ACTS server). For players and competitive events in need of security 
for cards and dice rolls, it is recommended to use ACTS (acts.warhorsesim.com) 
or a similar server -- the Vassal client may discourage "casual cheating" but by 
itself cannot provide meaningful security.

                    <h3 style="font-size:26px">2. Cards</h3>
          <p style="font-size:22px;"> To 
reduce window clutter, card decks have been placed on the main map below the 
board. Cards can be drawn through several methods, including right-clicking on 
the draw pile, or the "Draw" buttons in each player's hand window. <br><br> 
<strong>Playing Cards: </strong> Select a card in your hand, right click, and 
choose from: Play as Event (<strong>Ctrl+E</strong>) to play as an "EC" or Play 
for OPS (<strong>Ctrl+O</strong>) to play as an OC. There is also a "discard" 
option. <br><br> <strong>Random Discards: </strong> In each player hand window 
is a button which will cause a single card to be randomly discarded - use when 
this is required by an event.

>&nbsp;<img src="FortUSA.png"><h3 style="font-size:26px">3. Units 
and Markers</h3>
            <p style="font-size:22px;"> PC Markers, Forts, Armies, Generals, 
SP's, and the various map markers are separated into different game piece layers 
to prevent accidental movement and stacking. The drawing order from bottom to
top PC Markers, Forts, SPs, Generals, Armies, Status Markers, Cards. Units of
the same exact type placed in a space will stack with other units there (double
click to expand a stack so that individual pieces can be clicked on).


    <br><br><img src="examplereorg.png" 
><br><br><strong>Automatic Stack Organization: </strong>When this feature is on, 
groups of
    units will auto-organize when placed in the same space, so that the contents
    of the space are easier to view. Several organization formats are 
    automatically switched between, including a "battle mode" when forces from 
    both players are present in the same space. This auto-organization DOES use 
    come computation power, and can be adjusted under the 
    "Rules and Prefs" button on the toolbar. Even when off, auto-reorg can be 
    invoked manually using <strong>Ctrl+A</strong>. Even when auto-organized, 
    pieces can then be manually readjusted within a space without harm. 

<br><br><img src="ANVfront.png" >&nbsp;
<img src="AoPfront.png" hspace="20" ><h3 style="font-size:26px">4. Armies</h3>
           <p style="font-size:22px;"> If sufficient SP are present in a space, 
an army can be created by right-clicking on the General you wish to put in 
command and selecting the desired army. Creating an army in this fashion will 
automatically manage Strategic Will adjustments; an army can still of course be 
"created" manually by dragging its piece to the map and moving appropriate 
generals manually to its display area. 
               <br><br><strong>Army Counter Stats: </strong>The current SP 
               strength of an army is shown as a large numeral on the lower 
               right of the counter. The Strategy rating of the army's commander 
               (or 3 if no commander i.e. "default" commander) is shown on the 
               left side of the counter. Next to the strategy rating will appear 
               an asterisk (*) if the army contains at least one cavalry 
               brigade, or an exclamation point (!) if it is a "Mongol Army" 
               consisting entirely of cavalry SP and therefore not allowed e.g. 
               to flip PC markers.
    <br><br><strong>Picking Up and Dropping Off SP's: </strong>With an army 
    selected, using the <strong>PGDN</strong> key will cause an SP to be dropped 
    off in the current space, and one point will automatically be deducted from 
    the army's strength display. Similarly, the <strong>PGUP</strong> key will 
    pick up a strength point and add it to the army. <strong>Ctrl+PGUP</strong> and 
    <strong>Ctrl+PGDN</strong> will pickup/dropoff larger groups of strength 
    points. <br><br><strong>Picking Up and Dropping Off Generals and Cavalry:
    </strong>Armies can similarly drop off and pick up Generals using
    <strong>Ctrl+G/Alt+G</strong>, and they can drop off and pick up Cavalry 
    using <strong>Ctrl+V/Alt+V</strong>. 
               <br><br><strong>Dropping Off Corps: </strong>Sometimes when 
               dropping off a corps
    from a large army it is convenient to simply dump the entire contents of the 
    army (except for its commander) into the current space, examine the various 
    generals, cavalry, and SP's available, and then pick everything left back up 
    again when once the corps moves off. This can be done with the  
    <strong>Ctrl+Shift+PGDN</strong> key to drop everything off and the 
    <strong>Ctrl+Shift+PGUP</strong> key to pick everything back up. 
    <br><br><strong>Manually Adjusting Army Strength: </strong>With an army 
    selected, hitting the + and - keys on the Numpad will manually adjust the 
    army's strength. Or hitting <strong>Ctrl+1</strong> through 
    <strong>Ctrl+9</strong> will directly set the army's strength to a value 1 
    through 9. <strong>Alt+0</strong> through <strong>Alt+5</strong> will set 
    the strength from 10 to 15. The Army SP marker on the army display can also 
    of course be manually adjusted (or any of these hotkeys can be used with the 
    Army SP marker selected). <br><br><strong>Eliminating/Removing Armies: 
    </strong>Pressing <strong>Ctrl+E</strong> with an Army selected will 
    eliminate that army, sending generals and cavalry to the appropriate turn on 
    the turn track for future re-entry. Strategic Will will be adjusted for loss 
    of an Army, including an additional penalty of the commanding general's 
    political rating if there is another army in the space.

<h3 style="font-size:26px">5. Generals</h3><p style="font-size:22px;"> 
Newly arriving generals are
    available near the turn track at the lower right of the map, each just above
    the appropriate turn for that general to arrive. 
    <br><br><strong>Randomizing
    New Generals: </strong>A stack of newly arriving generals can be randomized
    by right clicking their stack and selecting the "Randomize Generals" 
    (<strong>Ctrl+R</strong>) option. They will be flipped upside down and 
    randomized. The upside-down tokens can then be dragged to desired locations 
    to assign them, before flipping them back up to reveal them. 
    <br><br><strong>Randomizing General Casualties:
    </strong>When a general needs to be selected randomly as a casualty, this
    can be done by stacking all the generals who qualify to be casualties in a
    single stack (including, if applicable, Cavalry Brigades) and then selecting
    the "Randomize" option. The General (or Cavalry Brigade) which is randomized
    to the top of the stack is the one which should be taken as the casualty.

    <br><br><strong>Generals With Armies: </strong>Generals on an army display 
    will have a right+click option to allow them to be placed on the map with 
    their army. Likewise Generals on the map in a space with an army will have 
    an option to send them to the army display. Generals in the "turn track" 
    region also have several "quick deploy" options to place them with armies or 
    in common locations on the map.

<h3 style="font-size:26px">6. Cavalry Brigades</h3><p style="font-size:22px;"> 
Cavalry Generals have a 
    menu option allowing them to form a cavalry brigade when an SP is present 
    with them on the map (or in the army to which they've been assigned). 
    Cavalry Strength points will thenceforth register as an SP when present on 
    an Army display, and will be properly tracked when picked up and dropped 
    off. Cavalry Brigade pieces have appropriate right+click options when either 
    the SP or the General need to be taken as casualties. If the "Cavalry 
    General Replacements" optional rule is in effect, killed Cavalry Generals 
    will automatically have their substitutes added to the turn track as 
    appropriate.

<h3 style="font-size:26px">7. Strategic Will</h3><p style="font-size:22px;"> 
    There are several ways to adjust Strategic Will (in addition to manually 
    adjusting it by moving/flipping the counters on the display). 
    <br><br><strong>1. The Strategic Will screen (Alt+W) </strong> contains 
    buttons which can be clicked to apply an adjustment -- these will in turn 
    apply an appropriate "fortunes of war" additional adjustment when the SW 
    momentum flips between + and -. <br><br><strong>2. Playing an Event Card 
    </strong> that includes an SW adjustment will automatically make the 
    adjustment, including fortunes-of-war bonuses and penalties. 
    <br><br><strong>3. Displacing a Capital </strong> will automatically apply 
    the appropriate SW penalty and fortunes of war. <br><br> <strong>4. 
    Destroying a Resource Site </strong> will automatically apply appropriate SW 
    adjustments. <br><br> <strong>5. Controlling a State: </strong>When a State 
    Control marker is placed (or flipped) in the square for a state, appropriate 
    SW adjustments will be made automatically.

<h3 style="font-size:26px">8. PC Markers and State Control</h3><p style="font-size:22px;">The numbers of PC Markers present in 
Border States, and the number of Union PC Markers in Confederate States (and 
Confederate PC Markers in Union States) are automatically tracked and displayed 
near the state's name. If a Border State becomes Confederate Controlled, only 
the Union PC Markers will henceforth be tracked; once a Border State becomes 
Union Controlled no further tracking is necessary and the tracking numbers 
disappear.
<br><br>
<img src="exampleempty.png"><br><br>
<h3 style="font-size:26px">9. Empty Spaces and menus</h3><p style="font-size:22px;">Clicking on an empty space allows access to a 
special right+click menu (and special hotkeys) for that space -- for example 
SP's can be added directly, or PC Markers, without the need to drag them from 
the Markers display (but the Markers display is also available for players who 
prefer it). With an empty space selected, <strong>Ctrl+1</strong> through 
<strong>Ctrl+6</strong> will add a Confederate SP marker of the appropriate 
value; <strong>Alt+1</strong> through <strong>Alt+6</strong> will add a Union SP 
marker. <br><br><img src="ChooChooCSA.png" >&nbsp;<img src="ChooChooUSA.png"> 
<br><br>
                               <h3 style="font-size:26px">10. Strategic Movement</h3><p style="font-size:22px;">To prevent the necessity of repeatedly scrolling to the
left side of the screen to update rail markers while conducting strategic 
movement, global hotkeys are provided: <strong>CTRL+Numpad+PLUS</strong> and 
<strong>CTRL+Numpad+MINUS</strong> will update the Confederate Strategic 
Movement (Rail) marker, and <strong>ALT+Numpad+PLUS</strong> and 
<strong>ALT+Numpad+MINUS</strong> will update the Union Strategic Movement 
(Rail) marker. These hotkeys are always available, no matter what unit or marker 
is currently selected. <br><br>

        <h3 style="font-size:26px">11. Preferences</h3><p
style="font-size:22px;">The Rules & Preferences screen, accessed from the 
    toolbar or <strong>Alt+R</strong>, allows Optional Rules functionality to be 
    turned on and off for Cavalry General Replacements and Additional General 
    Capabilities rules. Automatic Stack Organization can also be turned up or 
    town. The VASSAL / ACTS preference determines whether the "Draw Specific 
    Cards" option for the draw pile will reveal the card names. 
    <br><br><h3 style="font-size:26px">12. Movement Trails</h3><p style="font-size:22px;">Movement Trails can be turned on and off for 
    all units with the button on the toolbar. The movement histories for all 
    units can be cleared with the adjacent button. 
    <br><br><h3 style="font-size:26px">13. LookAt "Flare" feature</h3><p style="font-size:22px;">Ctrl+Clicking on any part of the map will 
    briefly place a circular "flare" symbol on the map in that location to call 
    attention to that location. This symbol will appear on the opponent's map in 
    both server and logfile/PBEM play.
